documentation on progression

learned from old project
New try at making a microprocessor/computer (let's see what happens)

Requirements:
	decoding of instructions
	*1 memory channel -> single memory for DAT,INS,etc...
	memory management
	*adapting to existing technology(chips)
	useful amount of registers
	dependable r/w of memory
	*powerful mathematical unit

	-> clean processing concept

Problems:
	control of big memory
	organizing in memory DAT,INS
	function of jumps

SOLUTIONS:
	memory segmentation
	64 bit memory (no segmentation needed (yet), faster processing)

Idea for Multicore System:
